# 07 TODO

We will be focus on the following in this class:

- Need to finish off the remaining parts of the `client` service to list out comments.
- Need to implement a synchronous version of the system to consolidate communication of posts and comments into a single back-end request.
- Need to implement an asynchronous communication mechanism with an event bus to enable a scalable architecture allowing loosely coupled services.
