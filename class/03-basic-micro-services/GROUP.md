# Group Exercise 01

There are many ways to design and build a web system. In this course we are focused on a micro-service based architecture. This kind of architecture lends itself to the scalability achieved by large systems such as Netflix that require a modern approach towards building systems that scale. Before any system can be built it is important to not think about code, but to think about the architecture.

## Objective

The objective of this group exercises is to:

1. Interact with others taking this course and start thinking about forming a team.
2. Think about the design of a system that serves a particular purpose and create diagrams of what that system looks like.
3. Learn how to use the drawio extension in VSCode.

## Instructions

1. Form small groups of 3-4 people if this is in-person or be assigned to a breakout room on Zoom if this is remote. At least one person in the group must use the drawio VSCode extension. If multiple people create diagrams make sure to share them with each other so each person can submit all diagrams. Create the diagrams inside of your developer notebook repository.
2. Draw several diagrams (as many as you want) of the application described below. You must include an image of the front-end and the back-end. You must include both a monolith-style and micro-services based architectural diagram. You are welcome to be as detailed as you want and go beyond the diagrams demonstrated in class. The important part is being able to communicate your ideas. You must use the drawio VSCode extension to create drawio files that you will submit. Use multiple files/tabs for each diagram that you create or create them all on one sheet.
3. Add the diagram(s) to your developer notebook for this week.

You are not being scored or evaluated on any specific criteria that relates to the application below. We are looking for you to explore the design of both a monolithic architecture and a micro-services architecture. Be creative, play with draw.io, and get to know the people you are interacting with.

## Application: SnapBook

The world is overrun with social media applications. *SnapBook* is the latest craze that has hit the street. SnapBook allows the user to make posts at a specific time of day when notified by the system. The user is unaware of when they will be notified, but that they will be notified and then make a post. After a post is made, users are then allowed to comment on other users' posts. The posts/comments are added to a feed that can be shared according to several levels of visibility (family only, friends only, world, etc.). Posts and comments can also be set to disappear after a set time period. Users can set a default time for posts/comments to delete or never delete. Specific features include:

- Posting to the user's SnapBook feed.
- Comment on other user's posts.
- Setting post and/or comment visibility.
- Configure default post and comment visibility.
- And many more...

## VSCode Extensions

- [Draw.io Integration](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hediet.vscode-drawio). This extension allows you to view and create draw.io diagrams. Use this extension to create and draw your diagrams.

## Submission

You will submit this by adding the diagram file(s) to your developer notebook.
