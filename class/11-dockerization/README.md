# 11 Dockerization

This lecture covers the dockerization of the SnapBook application we worked on several lectures ago. We left off with an application that included the following services:

- client
- comments
- event-bus
- posts
- query

The goal of this lecture is to understand how to write a `Dockerfile` for each service, create a docker network, and bring the entire application to life inside of docker containers.

You can read the notes for this class in [notes.md](notes.md).
