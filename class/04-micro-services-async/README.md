# 04 Micro-Services and Async Communication

## Resources

- [Synchronous vs. asynchronous microservices communication patterns](https://www.theserverside.com/answer/Synchronous-vs-asynchronous-microservices-communication-patterns). A short article describing synchronous, asynchronous, and hybrid communication.
- [Microservices Architecture: Asynchronous Communication is Better](https://www.sysaid.com/blog/sysaid-tech/microservices-architecture-asynchronouscommunication-better). Covers pros and cons of asynchronous communication in micro-service based architectures.
- [Reactive Microservices: Why Asynchronous Communication Matters](https://www.lightbend.com/microservices/reactive-microservices-why-asynchronous-communication). A very short article arguing why asynchronous communication is important.

## VSCode Extensions

- [Draw.io Integration](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hediet.vscode-drawio). This extension allows you to view and create draw.io diagrams. We will be using these in some classes and you will find it useful for designing systems.
