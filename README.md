## Usage

You can easily access all the course material from this GitHub repository. We recommend that you clone this repository to your local computer and do frequent pulls to get the latest changes. You can do this in several ways. We recommend the [`gh` command line tool](https://github.com/cli/cli) as it easy to use and provides useful GitHub related tasks. If you choose to use `gh`, you can clone this repository by running the following command:

## VSCode and Markdown

If you clone this repository to your local computer, you may prefer to preview the markdown files, rather than read them directly. Use the [command palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette) in VScode and select `Markdown: Open Preview to the Side`. If you want to get fancy, I recommend the [Markdown Preview Enhanced](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shd101wyy.markdown-preview-enhanced) VSCode extension.
