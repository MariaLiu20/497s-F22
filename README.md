# COMPSCI 497S Scalable Web Systems

The web has become a large and complex area for application development. Access to an abundance of open source languages, libraries, and frameworks has led to the quick and easy construction of a variety of applications with several moving parts working in coordination to present to the user the illusion of a single program. In reality, web applications are extremely difficult to get right. They involve a large collection of coordinated services, multiple databases, complicated user interfaces, security and performance issues, and ever changing 3rd party services, spread across physical and virtual machines. These complications are further stressed by the large number of concurrent users that access these applications every second. This course will investigate several well known web-based applications and the technology and software architecture used to scale these applications. We will also study a specific topic related to scalability in software design in the context of web application architecture.

## VSCode and Markdown

If you clone this repository to your local computer, you may prefer to preview the markdown files, rather than read them directly. Use the [command palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette) in VScode and select `Markdown: Open Preview to the Side`. If you want to get fancy, I recommend the [Markdown Preview Enhanced](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shd101wyy.markdown-preview-enhanced) VSCode extension.
